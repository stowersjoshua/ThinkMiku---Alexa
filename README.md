I'm thinking Miku
================

Amazon is bad and requires a 1600 Hz sample rate, a 48 kbps bit rate, and running time under 90 seconds.
So this project uses a customized version Miku. It's shorter, and in a poorer quality. =/
The song is hosted on Amazon servers, and a copy can be found in /static.
